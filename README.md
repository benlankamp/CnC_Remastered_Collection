# CnC_Remastered_Collection

How to use:

You can use the vanilla assets, but this codebase supports the remaster assets as well. Please support EA and purchase the remaster!
         Extract TEXTURES_SRGB.MEG CONFIG.MEG to the same folder as RedAlert.exe(so the data folder is at the same level as the executable).
         
If you are using the remaster assets, initial launch might take a minute to generate the cache. This only needs to be done once, as more things move over to the asset cache, first launches are syncing might cause the same slow load, but following loading will be extremely fast.

For playing back audio you'll need to download the converted wav files:

The sound folder should be in the same folder as RedAlert.exe
